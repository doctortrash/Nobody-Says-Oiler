# Nobody Says Oiler
* Seriously, if he wanted it to be Oiler, he would've just spelled it that way! *

Hi there! I decided to post some of my old programming solutions to some of the initial problems available on Project Euler. I started on the project in around late 2019 as a super amateur programmer, using Lua because of my background in game development. My initial goal was to solve the first 50 problems using Lua, which I had eventually gotten around to a year later. After that, I opted to learn C++ and Java for future problems. I plan on adding my solutions for future problems later.

I found the files sitting on my desktop nearly 4 years later and decided to publish them to GitHub. If you're interested feel free to take a look. Some of them may be incomplete or poorly formatted because of how they were transferred.

Check out some of the problems for yourself here: https://projecteuler.net
